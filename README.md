# SublimeTextPreferences
These are my preferences for Sublime Text

To use the key bindings copy move_by_paragraph.py to your User packages folder. On Mac this is located at `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/`

Also copy the key bindings from keymap.json into your Key Bindings JSON
